# Gemonix for Alzheimer's - Mixing genomic data for an Alzheimer's cure
These notebooks use mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and micro RNA expression data from the ROS/MAP study available at [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3219045 "Sage Bionetworks") to understand the molecular underpinings of Alzheimer's disease. The results from this analysis are summarized in [this blog post](https://medium.com/project-alzheimer-s)

## Usage
You should run "for_rnaseq.v0.1" first, and "for_integration.v0.1" last.
